## Run

After a successful build, run the generated executable from Visual Studio (__Debug > Start Debugging__ or __Start Without Debugging__) or launch the `.exe` from the `bin` output folder.

## Controls and Demo Modes

The project contains several demos. Typical controls used inside demos:

- Keyboard/mouse input (see demos for exact mappings)
- UI toggles and sliders for spirograph and pendulum modes

Refer to the source files (`main.cpp`, `Beginner.*`, `BallBounce.*`, `MoveSquare.*`) for exact input handling and available modes.

## Project structure (important files)

- `MoveSquare.*` - Simple movement demo (unrelated to this project)
- `Beginner.*` - Beginner examples
- `Wall.h` - Wall/obstacle representation used by ball demo
- `CLibraries/` - Expected location for external libraries (raylib)
